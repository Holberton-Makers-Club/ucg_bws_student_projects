    <h2>Owner Bio</h2>
    <p>The Nails owned several businesses in Greenwood including the Nails Dance Pavilion and Skating Rink, as well as a Limousine and Taxi Service. James H. Nails was a proud college educated shoemaker, who was said to be able to take a piece of leather and make a shoe that anyone would be proud of. The owners did rebuild after the massacre, and a plaque with the business’ name can be found in Greenwood.</p>
